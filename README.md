## Project Overview
This project aims to estimate the population size of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) in the regions of Sweden and Norway. The methodology involves utilizing an agent-based model that considers diverse wolf pack sizes, including individual specimens, pairs, and packs. The analysis also incorporates the categorization of wolf age groups, encompassing pups, subadults, and adult animals.

## Technology Stack
The application was developed in Python (version 3.10) and leveraged the following libraries:

- [Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) version 2.1.1
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) version 3.8.0
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) version 1.26.0

## How to Run the Project
To execute the project, install the required dependencies using pip or an equivalent package manager. Then, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python WolfModel.py
